title: How I sync files
---
I use the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) in my Google Drive so I structure looks like:

- 1 Projects (stuff I am currently working on)
- 2 Areas (personal stuff)
	- 1 finances
	- 2 home
	- 3 legal
	- 4 health
	- 5 people
	- and so on
- 3 Resources (non-personal stuff)
	- 1 tech
	- 2 music
	- and so on
- 4 Archive
- Notes
	- Main obsidian Vault

## Notes

After migrating multiple times from and to Google Drive, iCloud and self-hosted. I decided to just use Google services.
