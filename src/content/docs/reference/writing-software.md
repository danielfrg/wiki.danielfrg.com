title: Writing software
---
I use [Obsidian](htts://obsidian.md)

I keep most of Vaults in [Google Drive] and some (like this wiki) directly on [Github](https://github.com/danielfrg/wiki.danielfrg.com).

On iOS I use [Runestone](https://runestone.app/) to write/read small pieces
- I would be happy to just send them to myself via email and move after
- I wont use iCloud sync because I have everything in Google Drive

Plugins:
- Minimal Theme (Catppuccin) + Minimal Theme Settings
- Hider
- Style Settings
- Trim whitespace

## Rant

- I have tried infinite amount of software for long periods of time 6+ months
	- Yes, Notion, Google Docs, Apple Notes, VS Code, everything
- I have migrated notes to every system in the planet, i don't consider it a waste of time
- At this point my requirements are not about software but about the data
- No notes in a database
- Everything needs to be Markdown files so I can migrate them to the next thing
- I like how it's [CEO thinks](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)
