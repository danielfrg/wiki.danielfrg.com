This website is written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
and all the source is in [GitHub](https://github.com/danielfrg/wiki.danielfrg.com).

- I open the `src` folder in Obsidian as a Vault and write most stuff there
- Sometimes I edit in VSCode directly

It is a static site generator build using [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/).

- This lets me use JS components as needed, for example in Svelte
- Website is hosted in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- CI uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/danielfrg/wiki.danielfrg.com/actions)
