I use Apple hardware (Macbook, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch) and Google services (Mail, Drive, Calendar).

- That way all the devices work in sync and all the data also stays in sync
- And I use the best product for an area
	- Apple services are not as great but I used them for years
	- Google hardware is terrible I don't think I could use it
- Syncing is not 100% perfect but its almost there
