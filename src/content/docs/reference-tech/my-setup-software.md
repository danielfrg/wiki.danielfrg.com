Almost all the software is installed via `brew`.

## Raycast

Mostly used for:
- Windows Management:
	- Mainly: ctrl + opt + arrows
- Quickly open Github Repos
- Open folders and Google Drive in finder
- Create a new things entry

Notes:
- I don't particularly like they are a big company
- I don't like it's a subscription so I don't pay it
- But it did replaced 3 apps into one so I use it
- I like the extensions and that I could extend it

## Keyboards / Hotkeys

I use [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) to do basic changes to the keyboard
- CapsLock to Hyper / Escape
- Hyper  + HJKL = Arrows

Then in [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) I use the Hyper key to do more stuff, for example:
- Window selection:
	- Hyper + F = Open or show Browser
	- Hyper + T = Open or show Terminal
	- Hyper + V = Open or show Code Editor
	- Hyper + G = Open or show Things
	- And so on
- Browser: If I am in a browser:
	- Hyper + C = Open Calendar
	- Hyper + D = Open Google Drive
	- Hyper + G = Open Gmail
	- Hyper + W = Open WhatsApp
	- And so on

Notes:
- I am still on version 7 and works great. When it stops working I will upgrade my license

## Other

- VLC
- WhatsApp / Signal
