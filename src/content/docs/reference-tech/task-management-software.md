title: Task Management software
---

I use [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)

- I have used it since 2014 probably
- One of the first Apps I payed when I got my first mac
- I have tried every app in existence, really
- I have migrated dozens of times and payed for all the apps and subscriptions
- I always went back to Things
- So clean, no BS, they don't add shit because it doesn't need it
- I don't need calendar or other stuff in my tasks apps just a clean list of tasks
- No subscriptions, pay for the license once and be done with it
