This website is written in [iA Writer](https://ia.net)
and all the source is in [GitHub](https://github.com/danielfrg/wiki.danielfrg.com).

- I open the Git repo folder in iA Writer
- Sometimes I edit in VSCode directly

Itâ€™s a static website generated with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/).

- This lets me use JS components as needed, for example in React
- Website is hosted in [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- CI uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/danielfrg/wiki.danielfrg.com/actions)
