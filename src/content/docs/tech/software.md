## Raycast

- Launcher
- Quickly open go-links and Github repos

- Create a new Things tasks
- (minimal) Windows Management

Notes:

- I don't particularly like they are a big company
- I don't like it's a subscription so I don't pay it
- But it did replaced 3 apps into one so I use it
- I like the extensions and that I could extend it

## Keyboards / Hotkeys

I use [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) to do basic changes to
the keyboard

- CapsLock to Hyper / Escape
- Hyper + HJKL = Arrows

Then in [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) I use the Hyper key
to do more stuff, for example:

- Window selection:
  - Hyper + F = Open or show Browser
  - Hyper + T = Open or show Terminal
  - Hyper + V = Open or show Code Editor
  - Hyper + G = Open or show Things
  - And so on
- Browser: If I am in a browser:
  - Hyper + C = Open Calendar
  - Hyper + D = Open Google Drive
  - Hyper + G = Open Gmail
  - Hyper + W = Open WhatsApp
  - And so on

Notes:

- I am still on version 7 and works great. When it stops working I will upgrade
  my license

## Other

- Video: VLC but also using IINA a lot now
- Messaging: WhatsApp / Signal
