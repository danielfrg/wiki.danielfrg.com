- Apple hardware: Macbook, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch
- Google services: Gmail, Calendar , Drive.

Reasons:

- That way all the devices work in sync and all the data also stays in sync
- Use the best product (no compromises - for the most part)
  - Apple services are not the best but I used them for years and mostly work, i
    could go back to those
  - Google hardware is terrible I don't think I could use it
