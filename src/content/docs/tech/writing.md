title: Writing
---

I use [iA Writer](https://ia.net) as my main software for writing.

I write everything in plain text files. Mostly Markdown.

It allows me use a great piece of software to write, no distractions and to keep
notes in different places:

- Personal notes in Google Drive or iCloud
- Git repos for websites

Things i hate:

- I wish it had Vim mode

## Rant

- I have tried an infinite amount of software for long periods of time 6+ months
  - Notion, Google Docs, Apple Notes, VS Code, everything
- I have migrated notes to every system in the planet and I don't consider it a
  waste of time
- At this point my requirements are not about software but about the data
  format. So plain text files so I can migrate them to the next thing
- No notes in a database or remotely stored
  - Websites based on CMS are ok
- I like how the [Obsidian CEO thinks](https://stephango.com/file-over-app)
  - Why not obsidian then?
  - I really like obsidian but I had to many vaults and I got tired of having to
    open the right one sync the plugins and settings
  - I just wanted on simple great app, one window, all notes in simple folders.
    iA writer does that
  - I might go back for Vim mode but havenâ€™t done it yet
